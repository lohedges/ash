# ASH-lite: a computational chemistry environment

This is a pruned version of [ASH](https://github.com/RagnarB83/ash) for purposes of demonstrating ML/MM
molecular dynamics with electrostatic embedding. See
[ML/MM functionality](#mlmm-functionality) for details.

[ASH](https://github.com/RagnarB83/ash) is a Python-based computational chemistry and QM/MM environment, primarily for molecular calculations in the gas phase, explicit solution, crystal or
protein environment. Can do single-point calculations, geometry optimizations,
surface scans, molecular dynamics, numerical frequencies etc. using a MM, QM
or QM/MM Hamiltonian.  Interfaces to popular QM codes: ORCA, xTB, Psi4,
PySCF, Dalton, CFour, MRCC.

## ML/MM functionality

Based on [code](https://github.com/emedio/embedding) by Kirill Zinovjev for the paper
"Electrostatic Embedding of Machine Learning Potentials", which is available
[here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6317807d49042a7e1ccde60f).

To use ML/MM via the [interface_MLMM](interfaces/interface_MLMM.py) module, you'll need to install some
additional pacakges into your ASH Conda environment. A quick-and-dirty
environment setup can be performed as follows.

(The following assumes that you are in the ASH root directory. We advise
using a Python 3.9 MiniConda, available [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh).)

```sh
CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA="11.2" conda create -n ash-lite -c conda-forge ase compilers cudatoolkit=11.2 cudatoolkit-dev=11.2 eigen jax jaxlib=\*=cuda\* mdtraj openmm pytorch-gpu torchani
conda activate ash-lite
./conda_setup_ash.sh
```

If this fails, try using [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) as a replacement for conda.

(If you want to use ORCA as in-vacuo backend for the ML/MM interface, or enable
comparisons between QM/MM energies computed by ORCA to the ML/MM predictions,
then make sure that the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables within
the `set_environment_ash.sh` script are updated to reflect your local [ORCA](https://www.orcasoftware.de/tutorials_orca/) installation.)

For GPU functionality, you will need to install appropriate CUDA drivers on
your host system along with NVCC, the CUDA compiler driver. (This doesn't come
with `cudatoolkit` from `conda-forge`.)

Now install the additional, non-conda, [librascal](https://github.com/lab-cosmo/librascal) package, which is required for ML/MM functionality.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lab-cosmo/librascal.git
cd librascal
pip install .
```

An example showing ML/MM MD for alanine dipeptide can be found
[here](examples/mlmm_examples/mlmm_md.py).
